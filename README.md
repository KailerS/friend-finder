## "The League" Matching

This app takes your answers to 10 questions and matches you with a character from the show "The League" based on your answers.
This app uses node/ express and is my first page that uses both back end and front end code.

To use this site navigate to the home page and click on the survey button.
Once there read the questions and answer all 10.
After you click the submit button it will compare your anwers and display a modal of your character's name and a gif.
